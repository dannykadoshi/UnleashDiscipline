## TESTING AND FEEDBACK

* Throughout the development process of this project, rigorous testing was conducted to ensure the functionality, design, and accessibility of the website. The primary tool used for testing was `Chrome DevTools`, which provided valuable insights into the behavior of the website and allowed for debugging and optimization.

* In addition to testing in the development environment, the website was deployed in the early stages. This allowed for real-time testing and evaluation on various devices and screen sizes, including both computers and mobile devices. By deploying the website, in the early stages I was able to simulate the actual user experience and ensure that all functionalities were working as intended.

* To gather feedback and insights from others, the link to the deployed website was shared with friends and family. Their input and feedback played a vital role in identifying any issues, and providing valuable perspectives on the website's functionalities, design, and accessibility. This iterative process of sharing the website and incorporating feedback helped in refining and enhancing the overall quality of the project.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

During the development process, I meticulously tested the website to ensure its high quality and adherence to web standards.
