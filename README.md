### 404 Page

The 404 page effectively communicates the error message, provides instructions for the user, and uses visual elements to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. It aims to help users understand the error and guide them toward finding a solution or returning to the desired content.

* **Error Message:** The 404 page displays a clear and concise error message, "404: Where did discipline take a detour?" This message informs the user that the page they are looking for is not found or is currently inaccessible.

* **Visual Representation:** The 404 page features an image that complements the error message. The image of Scrabble tiles on the table with the words "Own your error" serves as a visual metaphor, implying the importance of taking responsibility for the error and learning from it.

<img width="959" alt="404-page" src="https://github.com/dannykadoshi/UnleashDiscipline/assets/129149596/86da2214-89d7-45da-9af6-7b7d7f8c33ec">

### Future Implementations

* **Database Integration for Expanded Quote Collection:** One of the future goals is to connect the application to a database. This implementation would allow for an increased number of quotes to be stored and accessed dynamically. With a database, it would be easier to manage and update the collection of quotes regularly. Furthermore, this integration would also enable the inclusion of quotes from other authors, enhancing the diversity and variety of the "quote of the day" limited edition feature.

* **Image Quotes Page:** Another planned addition to the website is the creation of a dedicated page for image quotes. This feature would enable users to explore and share visually appealing quote images. Each image quote would include an inspirational quote displayed over a captivating background or accompanied by relevant imagery. By providing users with the option to share quote images, enhances the website's reach and encourages users to spread motivation and inspiration through various social media platforms.

* **Persistent Quiz Results and Leaderboard:** To enhance the user experience and engagement with the quiz section, there is a plan to implement persistent quiz results. Currently, the leaderboard only displays the scores of users who play the game using the browser. With the integration of a database, the quiz results of all users would be saved, regardless of the platform or device used to access the website. This implementation would enable a comprehensive leaderboard that showcases the scores and achievements of all users, fostering healthy competition and encouraging users to improve their performance.

* **Database Integration for Quote Ratings:** To enhance the user experience and provide valuable feedback, there is a plan to connect the heart rates (rating system) to a database. This implementation would allow users to rate individual quotes and store those ratings for future reference. Each quote would have an associated score based on the cumulative ratings received from users.

* **Public Forum for Community Interaction:** To foster a sense of community and provide a platform for users to connect, share their stories, and motivate each other, a public forum feature can be implemented. This forum would serve as a dedicated space for users to engage in discussions, ask questions, share their experiences, and offer support and encouragement to fellow members.

## DESIGN

### Typography
In order to enhance the typography of the website, I have utilized Google Fonts to select and import appropriate fonts. Here are the fonts chosen for different elements:

* **Quiz Headers:** `Montserrat`
  * Montserrat is a modern and elegant sans-serif font that adds a sleek and professional look to the website headers.

  ![Montserrat](/Docs/Montserrat-font.png)

* **Other Elements:** `Open Sans`
  * For all other elements on the page such as Quotes of the Day, Quotes Generator, Footer, and more, I have opted for the Open Sans font. Open Sans is a versatile and widely used sans-serif font known for its readability and simplicity. It provides a clean and contemporary appearance to the text throughout these sections.

  ![OpenSans](/Docs/Open-sans-font.png)


### Colour Scheme

By incorporating these carefully chosen colors throughout the website, I have created a visually appealing and cohesive design that aligns with the branding and maintains accessibility standards.

* **Quote of the Day Background Color:** `rgba(251, 142, 8, 0.889)`
  * This color is applied to the background of the Quote of the Day section, providing a vibrant and attention-grabbing visual element.

* **Main Containers Color:** `rgba(29, 36, 12, 0.66)`
  * This color is used for the main containers that display the primary information on the website. It creates a harmonious and consistent visual appearance throughout.

* **Red Variation:** `#c0392b`
  * This shade of red is applied to every first button on the page, animated icons located with headers, and the hearts in the rating system. It adds a bold and energetic touch to these elements.

* **Blue Shade:** `#122d4a`
  * Every second and subsequent button on the page utilizes this shade of blue. It provides a contrasting and complementary color to create visual variation and hierarchy.

* **Footer Variation of Blue:** `#12284ce1`
  * The footer incorporates this variation of blue, contributing to the overall color harmony and coherence.

* **Headers Color:** `#ffa500`
  * All headers in the main containers use this color, which helps them stand out and grab the user's attention. It adds a vibrant and eye-catching element to the text.

* **White Text:** `#fff`
  * The majority of the text is displayed in white, ensuring high contrast and readability against the background colors.

* **Quotes Author Color:** `#ffc845`
  * The quotes author's information is displayed in this variation of yellow, providing a subtle highlight to distinguish it from the main quote text.

<img width="1391" alt="colour-scheme" src="https://github.com/dannykadoshi/UnleashDiscipline/assets/129149596/aac7dd2e-b445-4ee3-a8fe-14c58f9f4d74">

### Images

For the visual elements of the website, I utilized Canva Premium. Here's how I used Canva for creating the logo, result images, and incorporate quotes:

* **Logo Creation:**
  * I designed the logo by combining a design template and a sticker available in Canva. This allowed me to customize and create a unique logo that represents the website and its purpose.

* **Result Imagery:**
  * To create the result images, I utilized Canva by starting with an image sourced from Pexels, then using Canva's tools and features, I added a quote on top of the image. This combination of images and quotes helped to create visually appealing and motivational result imagery for your website. 

* **Background Image and Page Images:**
  * The background image, as well as the images used for the Thank You page and the 404 page, were sourced from Pexels.
